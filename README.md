# DotCommander
This is an Open Source console file manager for Windows.

It only uses .NET6 framework and there is not any terminal emulator. The project is just a window console program.

## Build the project
1. Download the repostitory.
2. Open the DotCommander.sln solution with Visual Studio.
3. Compile it and run it.

## Navigation
The commander offers a wide range of shortcut to navigate through the filesystem. It is not intended with the mouse in mind but just the keyboard. Indeed all the shortcuts are allowed.

### Shortcuts
Page Up/Down : go up/down one page.

Home/End     : go to the beginning/end of the dirs.

Ctrl + L     : focus the path of the folder.

Ctrl + M     : move file to adjacent folder.

Ctrl + C/V   : copy/paste file.

Ctrl + S     : save as startup folders.

Ctrl + Tab   : switch folder.

## Why this project
While i was studying with my laptop i had the need of a file manager that could be easly used through the keyboard. I need to access fastly the file and navigate through the folders with just my fingers, witout using the trackpad because was too slow and decreased my studying flow (i usually use only shortcut whenever i can).

I created this project for the reason explained above hoping someone could find it interesting and improving the software with these ideas in mind.
